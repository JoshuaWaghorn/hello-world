Hello, I am Joshua Waghorn and I am 18 years old. I enjoy playing video games such as Halo, Rainbow Six Siege, and StarCraft II, practicing martial arts, hanging out with friends, and reading. I am a computer science major and I am taking this course in order to further my education in the field of computer science and to learn the basics of coding in C++. I have done some minor coding in C++ and C before but never got very far. I am looking forward to learning much more in this class.
